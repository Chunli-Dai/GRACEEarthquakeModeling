# GRACEEarthquakeModeling

The code here provides the calculation of coseismic GRACE gravity change, the modeling of GRACE gravity change caused by an earthqauke, and the localized spectral analysis. 

Notice: The shared code is for academic research. They are not user friendly. 
Some of the subroutines are not shared due to copyright limit.

SH2psd.scr: a shell script for modeling gravity change and calculating localized spectra.


Part one: calculation of coseismic GRACE gravity change.

1\ Preparation

Ggrid.f90: generate a regular grid.
changenameCSR.sh: modify CSR GRACE L2 product name.
            e.g. "./changenameCSR.sh filelist renameodir renameofile"
            where filelist is a text file that have a list of GRACE filenames in it, here are two example lines:
            GSM-2_2003121-2003141_0021_UTCSR_0060_0005
            GSM-2_2003121-2003141_0021_UTCSR_0060_0005
Subtract_Reference_SHCs_wwoH_NMAXncut_wstdM_SLRdC20.f: subtract a reference field (in terms of spherical harmonic coefficients).

read_SHstd_wwoH.f: read spherical harmonic coefficients.
